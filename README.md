# VBA Scripting - The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel master! In this project VBA scripting is used to analyze real stock market data. 

### Project

* Created a script that will loop through one year of stock data for each run and return the total volume each stock had over that year.

* Displayed the ticker symbol to coincide with the total stock volume.

* Note: all solution images are for 2015 data).

### Other Considerations

* Used the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing the code. This data set is smaller and allowed test to be conducted faster. Code runs on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.

* Ensured script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.
